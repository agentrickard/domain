# This module represents several services that could be provided by multiple modules in the Drupal community.
# The following are not playing nice together:
#   - A page cache policy service that uses the config factory.
#   - A module that implements hook_module_implements.
#   - A random hook that hook_module_implements wishes to control.
#   - The domain_config module (and domain negotiator service, I believe).

# When this module is functioning correctly, when a user logs in, there will not be a state key set.
